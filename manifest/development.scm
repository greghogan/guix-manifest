;; Clang Toolchain
;; clang-toolchain (as configured and compiled) can only be installed with the
;; version of gcc-toolchain used to compile clang/llvm. This typically restricts
;; gcc to a version several years old, but can be accessed by loading the
;; "(gnu packages commencement)" module and referencing ",gcc-toolchain" in the
;; packages->manifest.
;;
;; A newer version of gcc can be included using package rewriting on
;; clang-toolchain as done here. This does not always permit use of the newest
;; gcc; for example, in Guix 1.4.0 we can build with gcc@11 but glibc@2.33 fails
;; when building with gcc@12. Including the newer glibc@2.35 for core-updates is
;; not possible since package rewriting cannot be performed with an inferior,
;; and rewriting with glibc looks to simply be too large a modification and
;; results in out-of-memory errors when copying the package definition locally.
;;
;; The newest supported version of gcc for compiling glibc can be found in the
;; "Recommended Tools for Compilation" section for the appropriate version at:
;; https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;f=INSTALL;hb=refs/tags/glibc-2.33
